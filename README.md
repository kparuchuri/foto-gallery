## Edit - Feb 26, 2023
Committed the source code to this repository. You can use VSC to open this as a flutter project. At this time only flutter 'web' is enabled and working.

# foto-gallery

This is a flutter based web interface that connects to an existing pigallery2 server to show folders/photos/videos in a mobile friendly format.
This is just for testing purposes at this point, and please leave any feedback under issues/discussions in github.
pigallery2 server does not work well with CORS, hence you need to create a new nginx web server in the same domain as your running pigallery2 server.

To simplify all this, I have a docker image available that takes 3 properties as environment variables - PiGallery2 URL, username, password - and deploys everything automatically in a container.

Try it and please send me feedback. Note that this app runs as PWA (Progressive web app), hence most mobile browsers support this.

## Instructions
1. Create a docker instance. I use portainer, but you can use docker cmd line.
2. Sample Docker compose file is [here](sampleconfig/docker-compose.yml), its self-explanatory - takes 3 properties as environment variables.
3. Only PIGALLERY2_BASEURL_PROP is mandatory, PIGALLERY2_LOGIN_PROP and PIGALLERY2_PASSWORD_PROP are optional and needed only if you are running pigallery2 with login auth. This docker works both with and without auth enabled on pigallery2.
4. Start the docker instance.
5. Open Desktop browser and  and point to http://host:port/foto/  -  /foto/ is mandatory in the URL and hardcoded (for now).
6. Open Safari on iPhone and point to http://host:port/foto/. Once loaded, you can "share/Add to Home Screen" to add as an app on iphone.
